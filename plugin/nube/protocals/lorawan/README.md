# Chirpstack Sync Service

### Scope

A service to sync Chirpstack data to FF devices and points.
Automatically syncs devices and points from Chirpstack.
Can also be used the CRUD devices.

### How it works

1. Connect to Chirpstack
2. Request all devices
3. _Create_ or _Delete_ devices from FF to match CS device list
4. Subscribe to MQTT CS uplink topic
5. On MQTT uplink
    1. If no matching device in FF, request device from CS and _Create_ or _Delete_ to match
    2. _Create_ any points in FF under the matching device from the payload that do no exist
       _Note:_ We cannot _Delete_ points here as not all uplink messages contain the same data points in the payload.
    3. _Update_ value of all existing points under the matching device from the payload
6. Repeat steps _2_ and _3_ periodically (Mostly to sync device removal from CS)
